Git commit #3

- Made that, by default, every payment method (except cash) has the sales tax option as “on”. 
- Fixed bug where the weekly sales wouldnt show when filtered.
- Fixed bug where, if the user selected many items, the screen would overflow in the confirm_sale_screen.dart. Now user can select as many items as they want.
- Added filters for sale locations.
- Re-arranged the previous sales screen for more intuitive UI.
- Added custom date range filter.
